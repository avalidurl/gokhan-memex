  > I am a T-shaped generalist solopreneur, researcher, and conceptual artist operating across fintech, deep tech, competitive governance, art markets, and investment strategies. My research focuses on stablecoins, RWAs, tokenization, cryptography, AGI timelines, and global systemic challenges.
  > 
  > My main areas of interest converge upon the junction of stablecoins, real assets, tokenization, information markets, sabermetrics, and the ever-emergent art of investment.
  > 
  > I enjoy heavy training, running, cooking, sound art, cars, and history. I believe in the deep tech causes that will unconditionally accelerate our species toward a Kardashev-scale immediate future.
