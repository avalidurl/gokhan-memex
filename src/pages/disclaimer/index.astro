              <strong>None of the services, products, or research published on this website constitutes financial advice.</strong> 
              All content is provided solely for research and educational purposes. The information, analyses, and insights 
              shared here are based on personal research, experimentation, and academic exploration across fintech, deep tech, 
              stablecoins, tokenization, investment strategies, and emerging technologies. This content should not be 
              considered as professional financial, investment, or legal advice. Always conduct your own research and 
              consult with qualified financial advisors before making any investment decisions. Past performance does not 
              guarantee future results, and all investments carry inherent risks including potential loss of capital.

            <h2>Research and Educational Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              This website serves as a platform for sharing research findings, conceptual frameworks, and experimental 
              insights related to stablecoins, real-world assets (RWA), tokenization, cryptography, artificial general 
              intelligence (AGI), competitive governance, and global systemic challenges. The content is intended to 
              contribute to academic discourse and innovation in these fields, not to provide actionable investment guidance.

              This website may contain affiliate links to products, services, or platforms that I personally use or recommend. 
              When affiliate links are present, they are clearly disclosed either within the content itself or in 
              accompanying statements. I may receive compensation if you make purchases through these links, at no 
              additional cost to you. All affiliate partnerships are chosen based on genuine use and recommendation of 
              the products or services, maintaining editorial independence and honest assessment.
