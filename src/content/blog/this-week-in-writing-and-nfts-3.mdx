## Weekly MumblecoreThose who follow me know that I have been actively utilizing the opportunities that Mirror as a platform have so far provided. I recall when Mirror was not around, and only an alpha at times implicitly leaked as an alpha over Crypto Twitter.

People were excited about it since not only were it to provide a metabolist architecture to composable idea markets but also it was one of the few platforms that bridged the worlds of pure degens and novice natives who had a lot to offer to the experimental plane of arts, art markets, content creation, and marketing craft at the same time, broadly speaking.

Other than that, it was meant to be a publishing platform, a smol press which an individual would need, and utilize as a Swiss tool. It’s still the best, a very personal stance here as someone who finished the last Mirror $WRITE race at the third pole position when they decided to pause it. It is because some people like to play every local knowledge problem.

Seeing the potential of such a Swiss knife, now we have come to start to observe the proliferation of “writing NFT” based bloghouses (aye, a nod to Ed Banger records but not what it means to be a bloghouse).

### Wut Wen[https://twitter.com/0xgokhan/status/1558262196253097986?s=20&t=5J3haqhfqqrjcyu-V8uibQ](https://twitter.com/0xgokhan/status/1558262196253097986?s=20&t=5J3haqhfqqrjcyu-V8uibQ)

Culturally evolutionary oriented speculative intelligentsia markets will never cease to exist, and that is a good thing. As per writing and NFTs, the only thing that I think is lacking on-chain is the possibility of composing a web3 native .epub (or any other similar format) that can be both/either tethered unto another product and/or exported unto the chain as a rich media product.

The possibilities are endless in that one of the most promising aspects of NFTs in general has always been composability. Any threat to cultural composability should also be thought well such as easy retrieval of on-chain data.

As quoted below, Harsanyi makes a case in terms of data preservation, and some degens who didn’t hear about NFTs as a tech till Cronje thought of integrating them into DeFi, and some core devs who let others question their actions a lot raises questions about the legitimacy of some upcoming upgrades, IMHO.

## ParagraphAs I have written [the first week](https://mirror.xyz/gokhan.eth/VQyjhqWtm_3YlFLPQJ1ZZItBKVwhjdodnMMQ92OC58w), Gnosis Guild have announced Tabula which can be a shared content flow for DAOs, or a book that owns a DAO per se? Who knoweth? Possibilities endless.

This week, I have come to realize that we have a new player in the known galaxy of hyperstructural joineries (Media Legos). It is called Paragraph, and I like that it is called paragraph.

[Colin Armstrong](https://twitter.com/colinarms) is building the paragraph, and paragraph (x69 more times, paragraph) is practical for the following reasons:

- Markdown support,

- RSS feed,

- A feature titled **Communities** where you can directly token-gate your content, or publication, and for which I have been trying to find a solution. *anticommune* and *Writing Token* Discord members recall. Yes, there exist this and that solutions to that end, however, I want a Swiss Knife, which is Mirror and I assume it is on their menu to add such stuff—and, if I were running Mirror, I’d just co-work with Channel to experiment on the web3 media/ content streams as tweakable as it could get. Possibly a hardworking dev is reading this, and hating my guts.

- In this regard, *Paragraph* looks like a Leatherman multi-tool, and I love my Victorinox and Leatherman at the same time for several different reasons.

- Yes, writing NFTs require the skills of an on-chain bushcrafter. Sorry, I do not make the rules.

## Guild UpgradeI like Guild. I use it to coordinate at least 5 Discords. They are good, and professional as far as I am concerned the way they resolve the tickets in *Discord*. Plus, they are practical. This week, they shipped an upgrade among many that directly relates to writing IMHO: Token-gated *Google Docs*.

Alright, neither do I myself like those *Google Docs*—especially when they are shared across questionnaires, and the like, across web3 newsletters, protocols, platforms and the like. However, there are several practicalities inherent thereabouts, and people use them. I also use them since it’s easier to import snapshot .svgs onto *Google Spreahsheets* for a normie such as myself.

Token-gating docs have multiple-façade implications for any non-fungible ecosystems that run on content, writing, and collaboration. Few are aware but there are native DEXes working on *Google Docs*.

There should be a lab group ideating on and through platformless membership feat. writing NFTs, IMHO:

## the VERSEverse x SuperRareWhen it comes to poetry, many people think we are still operating in the realm of cooked demagogueries of orderly fanciness of the written word with a state of cleanliness in terms of signals.

As any on-chain poetry aficionado might affirm, these are the days during which novel media lay out possibilities for the long time tinkerers of experimental poetry, and inevitable practitioners thereof.

Practicers, I should preach. Blockchain poetry has its own cosmotechnics, and it might even offer a new birth of a new tragedy—as in we didn’t have a real tragedy till the rise of German Idealism as many a scholar argues.

There is a hub of poetry operating at the burnt bridges of Ethereum x Tezos for the least year as far as I can tell, and it is the VERSEverse. the VERSEverse is a full house with names from the experimental poetry vista if you are already familiar with thereabouts.

Recently, they collaborated with SuperRare to initiate a Space in the latter’s NYC gallery. I think that it’s a great milestone for text-based arts, and poetry in that I for one believe poetry is a form of art that needs no narratives—nor even human sentimentality.

Launch thereof featured names such as [Bök](https://twitter.com/christianbok), [Caballero](https://twitter.com/CaballeroAnaMa) (check her Right Click Save [piece](https://www.rightclicksave.com/article/poetry-and-the-new-meaning-of-curation) on poetry and curation, and [Florez](https://twitter.com/GiselFlorez).
