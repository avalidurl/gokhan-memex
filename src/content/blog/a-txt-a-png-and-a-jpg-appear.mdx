What if a wild text appeareth in a .txt file? a seed phrase? never to be fed upon the mouth of gpt-3? Who would give access to such a handsome font so negentropic that the non-fungible data walls of a permaweb strain start to leak info into the unknown metaverse?

However, the best ledger-friendly of the trio was a guy calleth .png who also knoweth that permaweb will be firmer than the existence of a vessel called 5d optical disc.
