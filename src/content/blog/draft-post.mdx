## Waking up

Your body knows that you have really fucked up the daily routine of yours which has enabled you to reverse it to a better standard compared to a huge majority of the global population thanks to regular daily HIIT activies, quitting smoking, cutting down on the alcohol at about 99%, re-starting cooking the every meal of the day whilst subsidizing the rest with well-researched supplementary intake cycle where you never opt for the cheapest products. 

You used to think that this toil below the incompetent at work would never end, and the subsequent long-enjoyed unemployment would never lend to anything other than a Shakespearean output: These violent delights have violent ends. 

Yet, you have bootstrapped a truer version of yourself into unison with the rest of your psyche, overcame sufferings inconceivable to others which you have always preferred not to wear as ID tags on the virtual networks as a signature of status; and, merely tried to manage to talk to yourself better. 

The last year was perfect in that you have literally broken free off the mind-grindings clogs of that which is romanticized as voluntary poverty where yours were bound to some misfortunes in terms of everyday networks, lacking of a mentor of any sort, and monstrous labor market in the given geographic constraints. 

Now, you are awake again browsing the captured meme images folder on your MacBook Pro that you were finally able to buy as a gift you yourself when you had made it the first time three years ago after a decade of orderly miserability. Patterns determine cycles of mediocre suffering. There are types of suffering, and you know you suffered more than this, and any type of suffering can be subsidized by a rational reformation of this irrational wetware compute server, and it's holeful terminals. Yes, even the once related to health. Accessing a proper health service. You thought it was necessary, and invested in basic health access anytime you had the chance to do so.

Yet, you are not feeling healthy nowadays, and this is why you are on this memetic infinite loop of a mediocre sabbatical where you chase your part of marketual ends. You can even snipe MEV bot snipers manually at times. Happened once. Remember?

You open Warpcast, and this time checking the builder related channels the first thing in this utterly boring weather of a tabloid description of Londonite climate in a metropolis that is well-suited to your bi-directional knowledge base thinking.

Open ChatGPT. Find your latest query instance in order not to perfect your prompts from the beginning. Programming worlds. Check your Roam Research kanbans, and trying to recall what longpost you were working in Obsidian.
