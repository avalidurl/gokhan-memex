A black hole is a media. Any media by definition, and nature, is able to transmit value in both abstract and tangible sense of the being that you convince your becoming of being in this ever-emergent deep time of liquidity.

A telescope, a recorder, your favorite sound artistsâ€™ noise scratching under the stress of that needle. You are sitting alone in a room, mumblecoring a *Worstward Ho!* of your own, and complain.

Whereas the sur of the tabla to which you are lending an ear, and an imaginary nostril is as refreshing as that black coffee you are about to have.
