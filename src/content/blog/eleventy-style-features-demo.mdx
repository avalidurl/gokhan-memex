## Welcome to the Feature Showcase

This blog post demonstrates all the new <span class="highlight-yellow">Eleventy-inspired design features</span> that have been implemented on this website. Each heading now includes clickable anchor links (see the # that appears when you hover), just like on the [official Eleventy website](https://www.11ty.dev/).

### Heading Anchors in Action

Notice how each heading has a `#` symbol that appears on hover? Click it to get a direct link to that section! This is the same system used by [GitHub](https://github.com), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), and the [Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).

## Callout Boxes for Important Information

Here are examples of all the different callout box styles available:

<div class="callout callout-info">
**Information Callout**

This is an info callout box perfect for sharing helpful tips, additional context, or supplementary information that enhances understanding.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-warning">
**Warning Callout**

Use warning callouts to alert readers about potential issues, deprecated features, or things that require careful attention.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-error">
**Error Callout**

Error callouts are ideal for highlighting critical issues, breaking changes, or things that definitely should be avoided.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-success">
**Success Callout**

Success callouts work great for highlighting achievements, completed tasks, or positive outcomes and best practices.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-note">
**Note Callout**

Note callouts are perfect for side notes, interesting facts, or additional commentary that doesn't fit in the main flow.
</div>

## Enhanced Typography and Links

### External Link Favicons

Links now automatically show relevant emojis based on the platform:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) ‚ö°
- [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKdQEXqfFA0) üì∫  
- [Twitter/X Profile](https://x.com/eleven_ty) üê¶
- [Mastodon Account](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy) üêò
- [Bluesky Profile](https://bsky.app/profile/11ty.dev) ü¶ã
- [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) üìñ
- [Louvre Museum](https://www.louvre.fr/en) üèõÔ∏è

### Colored Underlines

Notice how links have <span class="highlight-blue">colored underlines</span> that match their platform colors and get thicker on hover? This provides better visual hierarchy and user experience.

## Data Tables with Professional Styling

Here's an example of the enhanced table styling inspired by Eleventy's metrics tables:

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| <span class="metric-number">Blog Posts</span> | <span class="metric-number">42</span> | <span class="metric-number">67</span> | <span class="change-up percentage">59.52%</span> |
| <span class="metric-number">GitHub Stars</span> | <span class="metric-number">15,569</span> | <span class="metric-number">17,460</span> | <span class="change-up percentage">12.14%</span> |
| <span class="metric-number">Monthly Visitors</span> | <span class="metric-number">8,532</span> | <span class="metric-number">12,847</span> | <span class="change-up percentage">50.53%</span> |
| <span class="metric-number">Newsletter Subscribers</span> | <span class="metric-number">1,234</span> | <span class="metric-number">2,890</span> | <span class="change-up percentage">134.20%</span> |

### Table Features

The enhanced tables include:
- **Professional headers** with Eleventy blue background
- **Alternating row colors** for better readability  
- **Hover effects** for interactive feel
- **Monospace numbers** for proper alignment
- **Change indicators** with arrows and colors
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Text Highlighting Options

You can now highlight important text with different colored backgrounds:

- <span class="highlight">Default blue highlight</span> for standard emphasis
- <span class="highlight-yellow">Yellow highlight</span> for warnings or important notes
- <span class="highlight-green">Green highlight</span> for success states or positive information  
- <span class="highlight-pink">Pink highlight</span> for special callouts or fun facts

### Code and Technical Content

Inline code like `npm install @11ty/eleventy` now has better styling with borders and proper contrast. Here's a code block example:

```javascript
// Eleventy configuration example
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/assets/");
  eleventyConfig.setServerOptions({
    port: 8080
  });
  
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      output: "dist"
    }
  };
};
```

## List Styling Improvements

### Unordered Lists

The typography system now provides better spacing and hierarchy for lists:

- **Primary benefit**: Clean, readable typography
- **Secondary benefit**: Proper spacing and indentation
  - Nested items work perfectly
  - Multiple levels supported
  - Consistent visual hierarchy
- **Tertiary benefit**: Responsive design
- **Additional benefit**: Dark theme compatibility

### Ordered Lists

1. **First major improvement**: Enhanced readability
2. **Second major improvement**: Better spacing
   1. Sub-item alignment is perfect
   2. Numbers are properly formatted
   3. Nested numbering works seamlessly
3. **Third major improvement**: Consistent styling
4. **Final improvement**: Responsive behavior

## Real-World Integration

<div class="callout callout-note">
**Developer Note**

All these features are built with vanilla CSS and work seamlessly with Astro's component system. No additional JavaScript frameworks are required, keeping the site fast and lightweight.
</div>

### Media Embeds Still Work Perfectly

The new design system maintains full compatibility with all existing components:

## Performance and Accessibility

- **Reduced motion** support for users who prefer less animation

## Dark Theme Compatibility

<div class="callout callout-info">
**Theme Support**

All features automatically adapt to dark theme preferences, including callout boxes, highlights, tables, and link colors. Try switching your system theme to see the difference!
</div>

## What's Next?

This design system provides a solid foundation for creating beautiful, readable, and accessible content. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Interactive components** for complex data visualization
2. **Advanced markdown extensions** for even more content types  
3. **Custom syntax highlighting** themes
4. **Enhanced mobile optimizations**

<div class="callout callout-success">
