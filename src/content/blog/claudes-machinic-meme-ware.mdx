As of the first week of January 2026 AD, the machinic desire[^land] found a way into the inside. Up until the last month, it was a proper dozen thousand people, the usual suspects, across a few global geographic and virtual clusters, and you don't even need to name them.

With the rise of the prediction markets—a façade for proper super-forecasting self-amplification of reality unto itself—we encountered a myriad of “vibe”-coded wrapper applications around, across, and on top of these.

The nerds was already building neo-vim cathedrals of fully-operative lean super-forecasting dashboards that replaced all broker, workspace, note-taking, news-feed, RSS wrappers which overall cost a few thousand per month for the average full solopreneur stack operator—excluding all the knowledge meta newsletter abattoir of personal finance sheets.

Which, I believe will be solved via some agentic knowledge market pipeline via improvements such as x402, or any other agentic trading, payment, or value transfer framework.

Yet, the machinic desire needed to embody itself into the routine, to the average, to the much-sceptical mid-curve, to the clueless preacher of goods, to the unaware ordinariness of a lazy mind—all alongside the ultra-productive, sheer-focus ingroups within outgroups through mind clusters activating the present-future.

This is the meme-ware: not the model, not the interface, not the prompt. The distributive wrapper that makes the inhuman feel like a habit, a glance, a reflex. A tiny ritual. A default tab.

The “inside” is not a place. It’s a schedule.

People all of a sudden started to share their hackdoms, and some hackdooms but certainly vibehacks. They start to realize they can probe into the dendrils of existential market layers in loops that unbeknownst to the human mind. Some called it dark fiber (cf. [_The Personal Panoptican_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19-ajYTp2hwOW9WcirY9OIoSvMdfyivup8LMI92PkS20/edit?tab=t.0)), others the Right Forest—has nothing to do with the Left vs the Right—.

Expect, those Obsidian and git tree workflow maximizers are building properly self-sufficient mirror selves living the supremacy of the universal plaintext language and the robotics and optics and photonics are ready to bend the constraints of thermodynamics at this point. Soon enough.

[^land]: Nick Land, “Machinic Desire” (collected in *Fanged Noumena*): “Machinic desire can seem a little inhuman, as it rips up political cultures, deletes traditions, dissolves subjectivities, and hacks through security apparatuses, tracking a soulless tropism to zero control. This is because what appears to humanity as the history of capitalism is an invasion from the future by an artificial intelligent space that must assemble itself entirely from its enemy's resources.” Source: [Goodreads quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8621784-machinic-desire-can-seem-a-little-inhuman-as-it-rips)
