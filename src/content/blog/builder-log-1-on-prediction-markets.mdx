When on Polymarket, hide crypto markets. Polymarket is not a decision market for crypto companies whether they are a DAO or not—check the definition of "company".

When on MetaDAO, observe how crypto-economics enterprises try to build a decision market mechanism that can somehow in the future be leveraged into better rails.

When on The Long Bets, observe how meticulously their system is architected. Question whether they need a back up for the Clock of the Long Now to port these questions into the future. 

Get inspirated from Polymarket, Metaculus, The Long Bets, Good Judgement and Manifold Markets at the same time. You really do not need to burn your brains regarding the politics across these separate entities' ingroups.
