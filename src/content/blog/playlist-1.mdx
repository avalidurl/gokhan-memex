As I am sitting in a smart contract that is slightly more robust than the one in which you choose to be inhabit, and theorize upon data types and agentic instances, I have been also thinking [about](https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Iannis-Xenakis-Various-Varga/dp/0571179592) Xenakis' love of physical exercise, and Varga's fixation on the former's glass eye as if I am there, and recycling the sound of my currently muted monologue on the beauteous instances of sun-bathing along the [Lycian](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/aereal-view-of-an-untouched-patara-beach-in-antalyaturkey-picture-id1282840953?k=20&m=1282840953&s=612x612&w=0&h=0LTQpld76AMoroT5CDca4zID2BY1bxUDY02xR61zAJk=) beaches.

However, I am not [Alvin Lucier](https://www.documenta14.de/en/artists/5877/alvin-lucier), and this is not a piece of conceptual art writing that is but the work itself even though I have already appropriated the notion via a mint:

This series is sub-titled **[PLAYLIST](/tags/playlist/)**, and it is about what some *music NFTs* oblige me to feel. I will try to articulate such sentiments thanks to products such as [*futuretape*](https://futuretape.xyz/). I think 3 is an amicable integer to depart from, and accordingly, below (as if a webpage is but a codex roll) are three sound works, or songs, or as trail blazers demand, music NFTs that are the ohrwurms for tonight.

## Rewind ðŸŒ´ðŸ”Š

### 1) Bloody White â€” Beach Day

The rosÃ© sky meets the espresso sky at 6:23AM. Your body is half-buried in sand, you've become a bird. [bloody white](https://twitter.com/bloodwhite_)'s "Beach Day" is daybreak on loopâ€”a hypnotic drift between calm and tension, like watching waves crash in slow motion. The track builds with the subtle intensity of morning light, where each layer adds warmth without breaking the spell. It's music for becoming weightless.

### 2) Oceantiedâ€”Swim

A beach stroll in your headphones. The gentle strums and soft vocals of [Oceantied](https://twitter.com/oceantiedmusic)'s "Swim" feel like walking barefoot on warm sand while the tide kisses your ankles. There's something pure about this trackâ€”it captures that perfect moment when the ocean feels endless and time moves differently. Let it wash over you.
