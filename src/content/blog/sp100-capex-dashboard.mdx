When I was first involved with then-emergent DeFi scene in the summer of 2020 aka DeFi Summer, I was one of those kids in a Japanese grammar class who didn't know it was even better to learn Kana first. You had the Anki, cheap Steam games, free nerd material all over the place.

However, the art of dashboard making, data analysis etc. were totally alien to me as a speculative archivist with a qualitative background in American and comparative literature.

In the heat of the now, I kept graduating from one sub-sector to another and over the years, I have started to appreciate what is usually termed as TradFi in the quantitative, technical, algorithmic and machine learning sides since it all is part of a thermo-dynamic cycle that utilize DeFi and its adjacent systems, too.

One of the worst things about being a fully qualitative one is that it's even harder to master the art of coding, programming etc. by mere manual labor of Google search results.

I can easily admit that having access first to base LLM models in consumer-facing UIs, and now via rather affordable coding agent flows thereof, have been revolutionary for myself.

Today, I can build ultra-secure context-gardens that filter out the information sandbox I am exploring with the help of that which is arriving from the future. It is a practice, the side dishes of which could be turned into workable product prototypes either in the most FOSS or balanced proprietary sense possible.
