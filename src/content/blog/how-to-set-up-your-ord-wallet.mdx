# Briefing

[Inscription content is entirely on-chain,](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)

[stored in taproot script-path spend scripts.](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)

`YES, YOU NEED TO RUN A FULL NODE TO INSCRIBE INSCRIPTIONS YOURSELF, ANON.`

## 0. Readme.kekmd.

**Do not read and directly FOMOskip into [the third chapter](https://gokhan.substack.com/i/101022954/how-to-easily-set-up-an-ord-wallet-compatible-sparrow-wallet) if you wanna self-rug anon.**

This is a simpleton’s guide on how to set up an `ord` compatible *Bitcoin* wallet with *[Sparrow Wallet](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980)* as referenced in the *[Ordinal Theory Handbook](https://docs.ordinals.com/).*

**I am that simpleton.**

It is exclusively aimed at those who try to understand what *[Ordinals](https://discord.gg/ordinals)* and the *inscriptions* are, or anxious that they’ll not get a piece of *[Taproot Wizards](https://discord.gg/taprootwizards)* just because they do not have an `ord` wallet, or a wallet that is compatible with the `ord` wallet.

**I am publishing this simple guide that might contain errors, or be obsolete in the unconditionally accelerating phase of ever-emergent blockspace wars. It is up to you to write your own guide, or just DM me somewhere so that I can update it.**

I myself wanted to experiment with *Ordinals* in that they provide that raw block-based almost-only-text-mode artistic engineering canvas—which is why I am writing this, a self-note, if you prefer.

## 1. Be Wary of Self-Keks

> [These inscribed sats can then be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. These transactions, addresses, and UTXOs are normal bitcoin transactions, addresses, and UTXOS in all respects, with the exception that in order to send individual sats, transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according to ordinal theory.](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)

### ☣️ Before you proceed into this arduous journey of reading more than 333 words, I need to accentuate that:

🦍 *Ordinals* do **not** function in the way of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to which you are accustomed across the multi- and cross-chain constellations of rektistan. [They have their own](https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html)`inscriptions` which helps you inscribe, or write into, `satoshis` any arbitrary content.

🦍 Here, you are dealing with the way `UTXO`s work, that is `first-in-first-out`, ***not ***`the usual way`* individual **NFTs, or a collection acts or is acted upon in the usual EVM settings** thereof*.

🦍 You might inadvertently, and without any technical or security-related effort, rug yourself of that beauteous digital and cultural object of craftsmanship, that is, an ordinal just by using the UTXO that is more or less the ordinal that you hold.

### ☣️ As is clearly stated in the Handbook:

🐸 “Ordinals is a numbering scheme that allows tracking and transferring of individual satoshis.”

🐸 ”Satoshis are numbered in the order in which they're mined, and transferred from transaction inputs to transaction outputs first-in-first-out. Both the numbering scheme and the transfer scheme rely on *order*, the numbering scheme on the *order* in which satoshis are mined, and the transfer scheme on the *order* of transaction inputs and outputs. Thus the name, *ordinals.”*

🐸 You can attach assets such as NFTs, securities, accounts, stablecoins to ordinals. That is, **Ordinals themselves are not NFTs.**

### ☣️ After you have created a wallet for your ordinals, you need to memorize the facts that:

😎 If you have used the vanilla `ord` option to create wallet, you need to re-read the details as to how to hold, protect, or exchange your ordinals in the `ord`[Github documentation page](https://github.com/casey/ord).

😎 Instead of using the above-listed method, I assume that you have used the *Sparrow Wallet* integration, you’ll need to re-read all the details in [receiving inscriptions and ordinals with Sparrow wallet](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980).

😎 As [windsok](https://twitter.com/windsok) warns in the above-linked guide:

**“[As a general rule if you take this approach, you should use this wallet with the Sparrow software as a receive-only wallet. Do not spend any satoshis from this wallet unless you are sure you know what you are doing. You could very easily inadvertently lose access to your ordinals and inscriptions if you don't heed this warning.](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980)”**

**THAT IS, you would not want to spend your unspent satoshi that is inscribed with that precious content you boast to hold.**

# 2. How to play with Ordinals?

You want to collect *Taproot Wizards* that have made the news recently thanks to largest *Bitcoin* block ever mined?

The gatekeepers tried to censor us

But we mined the LARGEST BLOCK and LARGEST TRANSACTION IN BITCOIN’S HISTORY

added *a section* in the [original Github document](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980) *on [how to validate and/ or view received inscriptions](https://gist.github.com/windsok/5b53a1ced6ef3eddbde260337de28980#validating--viewing-received-inscriptions)* that are but transactions—windsok’s document features screenshots of the entire process itself, it’s better to refer to that page per se:
