The consensus is that there are certain human ages where one's market share of ideas shrink. Broadly speaking, this seems to be the truth. However, building products in the age of technological acceleration from biotech to LLMs and their future is almost akin to observing the gravitational waves for the first time for some of us who can navigate the contextual layer at ease.

You might be building a simple payments rail solution bucket for a possible agentic market, or a CNC machines for niché Martian terraforming enterprises, and you could be the same guy doing it. It's all about vision, and legacy sense of belonging in the species' culture so exuberantly that you want us to transcend the limits of the known universe, and boundaries of a given wetware full of vestigial and almost non-replaceable parts.

Some of your mutuals or friends might find your endeavors anti-human whereas another clique might deem you as blasphemous, and governance mechanisms of the Everyman and other critters might come to stop you accentuating the balance of the known universe, or some pasture out in the wild that could have been blooming with ancient flora and fauna, right now, on the spot.

Here, many men, and women accordingly, come to depress themselves with the idea that, once they've past the age of 30, they are unemployable at the future-making companies of today. From software to hardware, we encounter the same mindset.

However, I perceive such mindset as a side effect of brainrot, a weakling remix of capitalism proper by either the mindless, or the trickster.
