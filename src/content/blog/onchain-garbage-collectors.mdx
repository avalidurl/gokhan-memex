both solana and base are full of garbage apps whereas the former also is a sandbox for financial and social coordination experiments. re: futarchy, off-protocol interventions etc. that is, it's self-sufficient in the wild wild west period where crypto and tradfi converges into a better plateau of innovation. this ~3T tmcap won't suffice and will eventually merge (30.1T by 2024 per standard chartered & synpulse), and since 16% thereof will be trade finance assets, we'll need better DeFi. the consumer apthough, it does not mean that we won't have AI related, trulp landscape—where consumer is the state of mind of the retail who can also easily access the DeFi fintech rails and more sophisticated financial rails à la neo-banking and institutional crosspollination that marries the fully anon (ZK) with the pseudoanon + fully doxxed—do require better means. this AI, Clanker, DeSci, Memecoin, Shitcoin phase will be lost in the ebb and flow of the more patient idea markets that can practically innovate. y autonomous and automated agentic marketual, replicative science and research as boosted by distributed labs mindset, and entertainment and fun. majority of these will happen offchain and proofed onchain and it won't matter which pattern language you speak as long as it can gravitationally travel among BTC, ETH, SOL and main permissioned institutional L1s.
