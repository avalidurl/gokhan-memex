There is a sense of [*bildungsroman*](https://www.britannica.com/art/bildungsroman)-ship inherent within the current clusters and constellations through the blockchain(s) eco-systems—especially, thanks to Ethereum’s efficiency at helping masses, who act as if of a slime mould in a circuit maze, to go full composable, and accordingly coordinate, as a species striving for the invention of a novel “[we](http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80254/kant/kant2.html#:~:text=In%20his%20Lectures%20on%20Logic,What%20may%20I%20hope%20for%3F).”

A first-person plural that respects that of the singular to the point of the Singularity that is [arriving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiaWsgtJrNI) from the future to help us depart from ourselves, that is, to unzip the *.human* unto a thus-far unbeknownst formatting.

Some call it the *post-human*, others *trans-human*, and some others some other stuff. It is in fact all about *the quadratic inhuman*. That which herein matters is that we are about to arrive at the threshold where the transforming affect of blockchain technologies will be reminding us of our more-than-human capabilities in solving the [*local knowledge problem*](https://fee.org/articles/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/) once and for all.

Thus, it does not matter whether your favorite artists are making history, or not; since, the current non-fungible architecture, even the current ones, aye, are here to stay for ages, if we are lucky and avid enough not to infra-structurally get rekt, help them become of history.

Yet, there is a strange sense of becoming at this early phase of such alternative modalities of emergent governance systems, thanks to these technologically accelerating media of money and media themselves, as in DAOs: There is as if a sense of trepidation of an upfront and immediate collapse owing to the fact that we are still living in the old world.

Today, as I was reading a bound book, and taking a hasty [note](https://remixocene.xyz/archive/notes-1/) on my web2 site, I had to go through all the [rekt](https://rekt.news/) articles, for instance. It might be OK to get rekt financially even though it is *not alright*; however, think of the future implications of the technology of which we are already acting-out agents.

What if they exploit the body vaults on a far-a-day mint station in the outer space where you travel without moving but by minting yourself a designer body whose blueprints are stored next to your favorite artists’ pre-Longevity ouevre?

Hence, I am starting to contemplate on such shower-thoughts, as it is raining right now, here on Mirror. That is, I will just be focusing on speculative realities that would possibly be outdated with the advent of the IRL tomorrow.

For the sake of the first entry, I have also minted a non-fungible photograph of 20/20 editions that I took with my Fujifilm x100v.
