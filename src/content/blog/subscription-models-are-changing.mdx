Subscription models are changing. I know they have been changing for ever more. With the click of a browser add-on button, you could dump life-changing money into low-poly neo-chibi cult ownership of present future and some mental space online. I am not talking about these—nor negating their role in the great civilizational experiment. This time, you can just cancel those myriad subscriptions that might cost anywhere from low 3-figures to mid 4-figures for a random solo entrepreneur, or a nerd in 2026 AD.

I am aware that the forum, that is X, is full of random people telling how extending basic [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) Code and [Codex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) etc. have changed their workflow, and am not talking about proper developers or engineers but the usual suspects here. Yet, I need to add to the slop.

Many people cannot form the mentality here but today for a fraction of your monthly "builder" + "intellectual" software/ newsletter/ app needs, you can have access to proper semi-intelligent production pipelines that right now is in the act of transforming all the apps and products you've been forming a cult around either at remote or office or in your private man cave of some sort. 

[Internet-of-things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) might still sound as repellant as phytigal but this time it's the internet of agentic idea markets and it might be working.

You now have access to agentic planning, execution, neo-cloud based inference and compute, highly secure edge computing etc. for cheap and on-demand. You just want to "feed" all that might matter to you into a daily context graph and a proper UI rendition for your still-human-eyes.

As long as the [plaintext is the universal language](https://x.com/tszzl/status/1234567890) and robots can sense the world around them in an hybrid open source and proprietary hyperscale market structure, you'll have better times.

To borrow from the [DeFi](https://ethereum.org/en/defi/) sector, atomic composable transactions via account-less data and value transfers will enable proper digest that your personal context layer engines will deem presentable to you at the whim of a squeakbox that offers a live-feed and in which you'll have the routing and meta-aggregation of anything that you manually find in those pro lists, myriad Substack and traditional market journal/ gazette/ newspaper subs, [RSSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of this and that, gated content, trading courses, sentiment analysis for superforecasting, random trollboxes that can integrate into every chat in existence, random on-demand personal blockchains that can write to high-trust layers (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, [Canton](https://www.canton.network/) etc.) and nuke themselves in seconds to merely offer some proofs in the name of proper privacy.

Yes, we do have such technological infra today. Remember NVIDIA optimized the costs by 90% via [Vera Rubin](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/) and now offer proper precursors of [co-packaged optics](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/co-packaged-optics-cpo-book-scaling) in compute. 

[x402](https://www.x402scan.com/) is still a Wild West and people try out the capabilities of agentic idea and trade and whatnot markets. In the last 30 days, the volume is around 6M USD but when a proper competitor emerges re: infra-wise with either their facilitator or recombinant innovation atop, we'll see a context aggregation much similar to the "idea" of [MCPs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) but for interconnected agentic rails, too.

The entire idea of subscriptions are being rewritten and you won't have to pay hundreds of dollars either per proper research, or dataset access, or another [Bohemian Grove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove) or consultation or life-long learning fetishes of some sort. 

If you are building an application today, you need to make sure that it's not another burner on Product Hunt. Think at least thrice and build the continuity.
