## ## 🗣️ Weekly Mumblecore`🌴 Those readers who do not like to read long, or at all, can skip directly to weekly spotlight section. In Mumblecore, I just mumble into things, a portion of which you might not like because of my uncensoring habit of reading, and referencing anyone.`

Web3 has a purpose, and help humans find novel ways to cooperate, coordinate, and evolve. &, I do not like to call it web3, which in fact does not matter at all. We need character space.

❤️‍🔥 ***Thermodynamic miracles*, innit?**

We are also at a crossroads where crypto- and web3 have been contemplating upon where it went wrong when they decided that they should fork each other.

Aye, I recently think that they are not of the same ontology, which will be covered in a separate long-read.

You see I keep breaking the lines into bites so that people can want to dare to read a blogpost in 2022.

💦 **Marketual striations need a constant hydration of vibes**.

However, that is not our issue at stake this week. This week, I will keep reflecting unto CT, and its striated channels of communication across *Discord*, *Telegram*, *Instagram*, *Lens*, *Urbit*, *Mastodon*, *Keybase*, and any other beta product in *Apple Testflight*. What do I reflect on? It is that we all know: *We keep building speculative realities where a factual one exists to verify the truths that escape many a homo sapiens.*

**Rewind… No, not that channel.** Mute it. We are not going to talk about tankie attempts at short-term mechanism designs which include barring addresses that interacted with innovative contracts. The other one… Yes, the one in which some parties who have been silently importing their own political agenda unto the chain from that which many OG builders, dissidents, whiz kids, tarot readers, artists, surfers, baseball players, hentai freaks escaped a couple of years ago: *The cathedral*.

**Note:** I really am not a theorycel, I just suckle up good and practical info at times.

You might not like Yarvin. You might unsubscribe from my newsletter thinking that I worship syzygetic gods at the gates of numogram in the year 2013. No, I just read people, and some people have practical ideas. I’ve recently been reading only two names on [*governance minimization*](https://docs.reflexer.finance/), and *competence in governance*. One of them has been sitting on my browser tab for six months now.

In this *Substack* [post](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/optimal-autonomous-organizations), he asserts that “[c]orporate governance is not corporate management.”

Read it, you do not need agree with any view. However, the current situation where people who can now be designated as crypto-natives, if only and only we admit that ERC721s are no different than ERC20s now—approach to govern every agora, and forum, where blockchain ecologies thrive with *de facto* tokens that are their individual *statuses*, and I am only talking about *some* lazy people, not excluding *some* artists, who think that intervention into marketual mechanisms with short term authoritarian thinking **to which they are seemingly against in the first place** is a viable option that should be enforced right away. This is cathedral thinking. Three years ago, I have escaped with my all velocity from such environments where this thinking enslave many. **Here is my Austrian School of Economics themed Rap Opera.**

If you are too superstitious not to read some people, please do proceed instead to listen to this superb *Bankless* show [episode](https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/130-how-to-fix-defi-tokens-hasu#details) with Hasu, Ryan, and David where they discuss the importance of DAO management with structure, and a professional approach that is negentropic.

All that jazz I am trying to assert, and argue here is that, there are parties on web3 who are now more visible thanks to a tempest of contemporary art **collechton** during the last non-fungible run through the markets who think that authoritarian interventions into markets by way of language games, and now smart contractually, is alright. They need to be gently reminded that people in whose name they think they act are usually not from the advanced economies, and have been escaping those systems—**only to find on-chain know-how tyrants?**

No. No way, good luck in your echo chambers, and epistemological bubbles.

In this regard, it has been a week during which the words **curation**, **poetry**, **writing** in tandem with *onchain*, *web3*, *blockchain*, *NFTs* etc. have spiked only to be playdough’d in a race to be the first-first everywhere.

Marketing teams and uncanny artists are aware that this transforming phase in which online written content is now ready to be capitalized, if not perma-webbed, race to claim the so-called OG stasus—most of the time by showcasing their résumé that witnesses the number of established institutions which they had so far claimed to be hating, and only now utilize them as a ladder in the **cultural centralization of blockchain artistic environments**.

**You need alpha? Let me leak it:**

The blockchains constellations will be littered with the written word, its artistic remixes in both form and content, and **it is a good thing**.

However there needs to be an upgrade as to the definition of a bad actor in that some think that their good agenticisms is utterly good.

**exit>voice.**

**Rewind yet again.**

It would be *un*wise *no*t to agree on the motion that **collecting is amassing evidence**. Hans Ulrich Obrist argues in [*Ways of Curating*](https://books.google.com.tr/books/about/Ways_of_Curating.html?id=t-RUnwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) that collecting is not only curating information but cultivating knowledge as well (2014, pp. 39-40). In this sense, we can argue that any on-chain collector’s wallet is a cabinet of curiosities.

A cabinet of curiosity requires constant maintenance in order for the context thereof not to fall out of the contemporaneous discourse, and a discourse is not necessarily a negative instance of tubular and striated communication plane of a network.

**Wut means?**

It is to say that we want our collection of cultural objects to be relevant to the *information überloop*.

Hence, it would be safe to state that the narratives around *berahs vs bullahs* are structured cultural and financial instruments that direct the attention of masses away from unexplored nichés of the time-canny strata of blockspace.

Unlike these dominant narratives assert, our human friends and non-human counterparts thereof keep building on and through anything that is crypto, web3, blockchain whilst *pseudo-ethics* and *tongue-in-cheek subaltern ****(not the genuine one, that is)*** fetishists on-chain gradually become of these narrators that they themselves diss as bulls, bears, flippers, moonbois.

For the early bird and their avid flocks, there is a market at every block, and artists, collectors, traders, and other investors keep parroting that no-one is doing anything anew whilst artificial toddler intelligence is taking away their craft channels, and payrolls.

*Nay, that is wrong.*

We are at a crossroads here into which rich and structured media want to be staked through the technological infrastructures that make on-chain evolution of theirs possible where on-chain is still a primordial soup in terms of dimensional aspects, considering [data availability](https://messari.io/report/progression-of-the-data-availability-problem), storage, and scalability amongst many an other instance.

## 🫶 Weekly Showcase### fx(text).*fxhash* rolls out *fx(text)* to become of the writing NFT hub on *Tezos*. Considering the fact that there have been a run of writing NFTs, poetry promotional tweets by renowned influencers, and collectors across the chainverse; they seem to be aiming at funnelling the creative writing unto the platform. The only drawback is that *Tezos* is a non-EVM. I also think that the platform will be littered with overabundance of content only to be [TCR](https://medium.com/@tokencuratedregistry/a-simple-overview-of-token-curated-registries-84e2b7b19a06)’d (w/o any actual token but by the statuses of select curators)—and, this is in fact a good feature:

Congratz to the team.

### 📗 Proof of Stake, the book.As the [merge](https://bordel.wtf/) block approaches nearer than ever, Vitalik Buterin and Gitcoin team up to offer a digitally autographed copy of Buterin’s upcoming book *Proof of Stake: The Making of Ethereum and Philosophy of Blockchains* (September 27, 2022).

In exchange of a donation to public goods, you can also get a *non-transferable* NFT which comes with a digital version of the book signed in your name. Buterin will be donating the proceedings from the sales of the book to public goods.

### Proof of Concept #2[*Proof of Concept #2*](https://4th.energy/poc2/) by Pete Horn is simply a dApp that deploys an NFT computer, NFTC, ([a virtual machine](https://4th.energy/poc1/) if you please) on-chain. A NFT computer can help us exponentially leverage the cultural evolution of digital and cultural objects alongside their technical counterparties and infrastructure as in a fashion that has never seen before. Those who get it also gets soul-bound goosebumps:

[https://twitter.com/p_s_horne/status/1565093331293868034?s=20&t=aU8fQJ5bGApBIsEltMRQuQ](https://twitter.com/p_s_horne/status/1565093331293868034?s=20&t=aU8fQJ5bGApBIsEltMRQuQ)

Such a computer could have well installed itself unto the real world as an augmented reality piece of a concrete poetry that cannot be told from an architectural attempt by the senses. The future of on-chain rich media will be re-wiring the IRL in fashions unbeknownst to us. This NFTC is so primitive and thus beauteous that I already feel ancient.

## 👑 Read of the Week### On Royalties by FoobarFoobar wrote a thorough Substack piece on royalties as eponymously titled “On Royalties,” which is the most sober and articulate piece from crypto Twitter constallations that I have read so far this year, and I do mean it. Many creative people whom I also deem as friends will probably not get the gist of such opinion pieces in that they are usually, and superstitiously, away from any springboard from which they can start to learn themselves about the inner, and infra, workings of systems upon which their presence is turned into personal brands. However, as I see lately, so many an artist, or niché influencers/ growth hackers who painstakingly try to re-brand the hashtag CryptoArt alongside those who tapped into the liquidity engine of Q3-Q4 2021, and early Q1 2022 thanks to an on-chain contemporary art revival are busy virtue-signalling a la a smart contractual political correctness. They see protection, I see a collapse called Bommunism there. Anyways, you should read this Foobar piece in detail:

> [Complexity or excessive edge cases are often a symbol that you’re trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. It’s mechanism feedback that something isn’t right here. **Build things that flow naturally through their underlying environment without requiring excessive control.** Resist the urge to blacklist, to socially shame, to write too many if-then statements. Both you and your users will be happier.](https://0xfoobar.substack.com/p/on-royalties)
