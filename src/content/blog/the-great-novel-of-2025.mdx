# Some of you need to write a great novel or two.

You'll often find anonymous accounts quipping how and why we haven't had any great novels recently where recently is oftentimes at least a score of years. These anons are right. They also have the best X Spaces for what would be termed as an online salon. If you are accustomed to Sugrue lectures of late nights, you'll have fun listening to these people with whom you'd possibly have a more secular chat on a Sunday afternoon after the church than the alleged self-acknowledging knight errands of a liberation never.

Why would anyone write a novel though?

It solves problems for both the author and reader.

If it's a good book with rather a really good distribution network, it is profitable for the authors, and the publisher, and in our day the on-demand distributor.

You'd be surprised but Gumroad, Patreon, the Internet Archive and Anna's Archive are full of great novels. They just don't solve any problems at the global scale is all. If smart enough, majority of these titles would make it to my Kindle library. If it's really good, I'll also get a print version.

Some people tried to make sense of the rich media capabilities of some decentralized brands in the past only to be deprived of front ends in the end, and these "web3 content" factories are not fit candidates for emerging and legacy culture circulation.

The only sense the decentralized network technologies make sense for a novel, or any other creative asset is that robust liquidity composability layers, and archival projects can leverage the speed of payments, composability of IP rights dividends, and a rather almost immutable archive of provenance metadata. Anything else they're trying to sell you is nonsense for the next decade.
