I mumblecored on how I am devising my personal notetaking and knowledge management systems via Cursor, coding agents, and Obsidian lately. In the meantime, I come across a myriad of amateur and pro grade tooling to make it all better for the sublime notetaker such as myself. Do I ever read these notes again? To some of yours surprise, I do. I like how easily I can reach certain nichés of my thinking process, as flatly sculpted in blocks, as in Roam, or properly encoded Obsidian notes. Sometimes I accidentally stumble them in the workspace and at times I just know what I am looking for. As an avid archivist, and amateur data hoarder, I also came many times to hate a certain practice, that is, the act of not having taken that specific note, or the monstrous act of having deleted a certain entry or block or note, only to need it, for instance, a year after. Such kind of dynamic optimization leaves you with no option but go for all the tools. Yet what matters is the preservation of the database alongside the portability of the file system.

Here, coding agents do exactly turn your entire network of local machines, computers into a huge memex that is alive without a proper wetware is all.

Whilst browsing through what's left of Farcaster's social stratum, I came across a Simon Willison post (h/t Jenna). Apparently, Simon built a Python CLI tool that turn Claude Code sessions into basic and minimalist UIs.

For people like myself, it means that we can seamlessly navigate our "headspace" without a proper frontend in the contemporaneous sense. If you are coming from the "cryptoeconomics" infra, consider this: You really do not need a "blockchain" to do on-chain execution anymore. Yesteryear's oracles such as Chainlink today act as data broker pipeline upon which all-weather solutions such as Canton can build and any enterprise can deploy their even "temporary" virtual machine of choice to do financial trade magick, or simple tokenization of 5-dimensional bell curve memes in a datacenter in the outer space.

I am utterly excited about the on-demand lifelogging probabilities the coding agent economy offers today. I also highly believe that such practices will shape the agentic market infrastructure wildly if it's all about our evolutionary, cultural, and behavioral context.
