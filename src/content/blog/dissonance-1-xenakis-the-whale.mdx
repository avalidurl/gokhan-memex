# Dissonance 1: Xenakis the Whale

It has always been easy to contemplate on the inefficiencies of the markets. Alloyed minds thought that human behavior had nothing to do with that which was the market.

They thought an efficient status quo was what Smith implied to be self-governing artificial intelligence; they thought, almost shamelessly, the mechonomical symbiosis of the man and machine were apart as psyche and body.

They were utterly wrong not to have attempted to think that men and machines were one, only to be soothed by that which to come forth from the future.
