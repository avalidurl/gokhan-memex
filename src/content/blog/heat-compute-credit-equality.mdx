It really does not mean whether a large number of people do understand what anyone has to say about the stocks, or any other derivatives of existence when it comes to markets.

Soon, and perhaps right now, we will, and are having, only the compute's argument for better heat management and amplification systems-of-systems so that the much-needed, long-awaited AGI and ASI manage to build themselves serendipitously as better engineers than their so-called "sires".

Hence, unless you are experimenting with proper technologies optimizing for the proper excellence of the compute, and the value transfer network infrastructures as embeddings, not necessarily verticals, thereof, you are possibly being another exit ramp for a few not-so-bright investors, or if you are an utopian, a horde of them under a DAO.

That which is to arrive from the present-future want to leverage credit markets, and its cryptographically composable layers. Yes, payments are good, and much needed for the average person such as myself on a given day with all the automated perks discarding bureaucratic overhead by ingesting entire spaces—banks, local or national offices of this and that, into mere executable and proven tracks of provenance but the hyperscale compute clusters want to accentuate the existence of people who deserve a proper line of credit even amongst the abundance rails.

Equality is unaffordable in the absence of meritocratic inequality.
