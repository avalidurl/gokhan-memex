Aggressive acceleration is cute. People keep echoing the future of sand gods in the presence of the present. The sloppery slop enables better bottlenecks and humanity's shared mind provide the real cloud into near AGI, and nearer ASI, in reverse chronologies.

Molly Cantillon's doc[^1] is making round and she probably contacted you via her claude-run clone in the past to promote an app. Yesterday, when the post break the the mimesis point, at first, as I feel before any gap-less short-form sloppy influencer video, I just got tedium and ennui reading the first paragraph or so of the piece. Aptly titled, Personal Panoptican. I have no immediate relation to people buzzing around the post, claiming it's AI-generated, or disclaiming any concern thereof. I really do not even care if it's generated or not as someone who like(d) reading pieces off NaNoGenMo.

...& let's admit for a second that there are at least a million vibe-hackers who have been trying to come up with a personal Bloomberg terminal off-shot of a local sandbox with proper clones who can both order the laziest bowlslop to execute the spread difference toxic MEV in prediction market order books. Their Personal Private Transcendence. I myself have been building a few workflows around since I do need to own a proper terraformed moon around the next darkly enlightened proper oligarch galaxy system in near future.

Roon[^2] might be right that this post inflects a Borg approach, and Roon is indeed right here at least about the similar incantations on the mean of the average individual who are right now busy pitching up markdown presentations just because they shipped a repo yesterday—with exposed Bitcoin keys. It is also possible that just like you can encounter in any vertical-group clusters across SV, NYC, TX, the Holy Travelogue Network State Galactica and many TUI-subcultures, there are people who are slop-activated mindkillingly. You are kindly barred from making fun of this because those people will probably need some jhana activation therapy afterwards. Be Kind, Roon is kind here, and I also see people whose mere skill is to put a text into a AI plagiarism scanner of a tool that probably sucks and make hysterical assumptions around these types of posting, which is real-time confessional autobiography of a kind usually if you could clone William F. Buckley, jr., he'd probably agreed.

What I think about this type of virality, and the proper coding agent based acceleration we've been enjoying for about 20 days now is that "it" activates some high-agency people who have been led to believe that they are dormant critters with a latent mind-spatial inefficiency of theirs for years. 

These people, especially the ones whose personal-agentic (as a human wetware enabled embodiment here currently active on the Earth) are really excited. It's because they can finally overcome the enshittified social norms labelling them as "useless, old, failson, faildaughter" and all that jazz just because their smartness wasn't wired for the manual intellect-load of pre-LLM coding agent benchmarks

Just like a random power programmer confesses that they've enjoyed their most productive half a month in the last 20 years, I think we are at a viral machinic memeware environment where people come to "understand" what "it" is really about, which in turn expects a cosmography of what [Nick Land](https://youtu.be/FgEqQujsNTY) contemplate as the inevitable escape from ourselves, that is, transcending the species' limitations thanks to all players.

ps. I have been "coding" the entire day and I'll associate what you have to say about current social flow and hence inserting your pieces. I kindly vibe with you is all. Have a nice Friday.
