- A **tropico-brutalist** 🌴 dark forest 🌞 provides a prime example of a *complex system* 🦍.

- The interactions among species thereof range from *extreme generalists* (so-called NFT degens will consume most anything breathing in their path) to *extreme specialists* (Vitalik’s ‘rollup orchid’ with a foot-long development repo, can only be developed by an Ape with a soulbound dedication—neither would beat entropy without the other.)

- Do you know what Messiaen think of Xenakis when the former caught a glimpse of the latter as a pupil?

- A timpani, or a tabla?

- Imagine a tension on the pluck of a finger with a string abstraction on a Lute.

- pragma solidity >=0.G.M. &lt;0.WAG.MI;

- 333&gt;4'33" &lt;—&gt; Exit&gt;Voice

- Only a DeFi user can be designated as a degen.

- DeFi>Web3.

- Add another 5 timpanis.

- Comet Orchid. Rival Dealer by Burial?

- Ryder Ripps is more NRx than is Nick Land a u/acc-*ist*.

- Nothing compares to YSL in fashion and metaversal fashion suck big time.

- ‘Here was a man, Messiaen thought, “not like the others.”’

- You are about to get sandwiched.

- MEV bots are the real gentlemen.

- You are the sandwich.
