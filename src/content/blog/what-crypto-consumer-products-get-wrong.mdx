## Intro

In an age where basic large language models (LLMs) do literally weave through any product, we will, in almost the near future, not need majority of packaged apps. The reasons by now should have been clearer there. Crypto right now is bound to both the hyperscale economies of compute and its futures alongside its own scaling experiments, and treating liquidity optimizing service rails within orthodoxies of yesteryear's app building codes shall any more not be the law.

When I mention scaling, I do mean trusted hardware with bespoke connection around the globe, 99.99% uptime, petaFLOPS of compute, hence speed and wholly computable fully homomorphic encryption and its variants, easy-to-use MPC, configurable proofs pipelines, and the freedom to offer and have both permissioned and permissionless decentralized or intentionally recentralized networking infrastructures.

I believe there exists thousand terms to designate this class of products, i just use the packaged as a reference to those low or high abstraction wrappers around an admixture of application programming interfaces (APIs), and software development kits (SDKs) and neo-cloud computer and inference rentals either by the smallest of solopreneur developers or mere vibecoders, or enterprise grade initiatives. After all, we have a lot of clueless "solution architects" in the latter who follow the state-of-the-art a decade behind. Hence not only the average app stores are full of garbage, we also tend to port even trasher mini app stores on top of either sufficiently decentralized protocols or another L2s specific super-app. I check World chain app store, Farcaster mini apps daily for you, and I must admit that it's kind of a brainrotter nowadays. Yet, I do neither blame nor trash talk behind anyone since these type of application market places are easy to "test" user behavior with the product A whilst pitching the products B and C to the interested VCs all the while harvesting yield bearing UX fees on better-(re)programmable decentralized networks such as Ethereum-adjacent ones (EVM from now on as in Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Solana-aligned ones (SVM from now on).

Except for major lending and (re)staking protocols atop, and proprietary marketing making infrastructure, and a few API and context market enabling enterprises, majority of the crypto products as in the user friendly sense are just burner projects for either rugged individualists or over-warmed collectivities to bite some humor into some of you here. If you have a niché that powers entire networks (such as ASML in the case of extreme ultraviolet lithography systems) and I forget about it here, we have the comment section in the X article version, and Substack version of this monologue. For example, when I mention API market, I do mean both power fabs such as Helius or the average superforecasting context bundles we've come to witness with the rise of event contract, prediction markets; when I say lending, I do mean the likes of Aave or Morpho. I do not mention real world asset infrastructure so far in that that category will dissolve into dozen ones soon, currently stablecoins being the largest.

We all know that civilization-designating emergent technologies and their markets are a checks-and-balances fog-of-war puzzle where economies of scale force us to stick to the most practical parts when it comes to building systems-of-systems to define further for the markets to act; and, for some time, preferably not for a long while, it's reasonably probable to embrace some trade-offs.

During the long now of the first years of the so-called decentralized markets, in order to see the potential, we let the market infrastructure builders to play with the idea of isolated liquidity to the degree of shredding cash into fruitless ends. After all, majority of players had no sense of any mechanism of debt-creation. We also let them create kindergartens among ingroups, and outgroups, to play childlike lottery games not so much different from the average shitcoin not so smart contracts. It's because that's how grownups who romanticize anarchy treat one another. Only through this mayhem were we able to come up with proper configurations for money lego markets.

Seeing the proper verticals, people from both the so-called DeFi and traditional finance quarters, at least the most honorably honest ones, wanted to build hybrid systems only to be roasted forever whilst easing the lives of millions of users across the world. Moral preachers needed to roast them for it's the only way they could relate and be remembered since "crowds", as in the "wisdom of crowds" woke up to the fact that we now have proper tech to accelerate into futures better than this both in the short and long now of the sense of existence, and capital under these decentralized markets either are not deployed properly.

## A Burner App is not an App

Whereas "bright" builders will call it day one everyday as if automating baseless hope into cliché half-marathons, it's already 2026-03-01. As we are timing idea markets proper, the USG have just extracted Maduro off Venezuela, and your brightest app devs expect LATAM people to burn hours on trashy hamster wheels of an app. 

"Test in prod" is cool only if you are building something tangible enough to require the resources to allocate into for proper maintenance, serviceability and manufacturability. 

You are getting it wrong that people will be here to idle at your gacha machines. They have already mastered the art of investments, savings, and derivatives. 

They want proper bespoke liquid market networks with accountable services where they can also "manufacture" proper print-less private money flow instances with enough proof-of-innocence. They don't want vaporwave, they want hardware-adjacent digital money that can feel like the good old cash.
