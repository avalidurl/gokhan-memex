There is a misconception on who a degen is. Degens I know shipped needed structured products, & they do not resent. However, calling people who play for delegation, & engagement farming by deploying 1000s of haters a degen creates a gambling eco that does not test anything. Airdrop farming is a side effect of quests.

Quests are the rent extractors that were apparently needed when some protocols thought that dealing with testnets were burdensome time-preferentially, and they needed vaporwave masses to test in prod.

Who are these masses *even if only some portion of them are vaporwave*?

- Actual degens who are easily nerd-sniped by crypto-primitives

- Devs & builders who like to experiment

- Strategic *black hat* airdrop farmers with an army of not only bots but in actual people who are paid to operate these farming well

- Clueless and well-meaning, *or not*, market participants who are new to the game

Somewhere along the lines of mid-2022, and early 2023, quests have turned into shitcoing farming except a few early protocols thereof. 

![](https://paragraph.xyz/editor/callout/information-icon.png)Many product managers and core devs with whom I exchanged roadmap ideations were always irritated and uneasy about these quests—they still are. They know that it reflects nothing. 

**Are all aidrops bad?**

No, as long as they do not treat each and every participant like a thirsty coyote. If you are imagining that a perfect airdrop strategy is possible for vaporwave masses via sybils, please check the previous sybil hunts where aforementioned whales with literal click farms kept continually **dust-attacking** thousands of wallets everyday.

`Dust attacks` are a malicious method where otherwise eligible wallets are instrumented into a network of addresses whose main origin then looks like a liquidity seeding address. Seeing these, many "community police" think that legit adresses are sybils.

**KYC**

Some people think that KYC is an option. Yes, it is—as long as it is **not** CEX based, or CEX-exported. Many CEXes have withdrawn from the unpriviliged regions. The very same regions that some good-willing builders think deserve better opportunities, and they are not either aware of dust attacks or non-access to CEXes—early airdrops helped me bootstrap myself onto the ecosystem but we were not toiling in bridge-operated rotational gulags.

**So you want to design a well-functioning airdrop?**

- Award devs, node operators, miners/ stakers, solvers, blockbuilders, sequencers and the like since some of these are interchangable due to recent development proposals, and might mean different in the context of different networks

- Award "community" who does not resent but directly inform you of your choices' robustness by actively participating without any quests

If a sybil resistance is needed, instrumentalize ZK based proving processes, and check if the infrastructure providers have geo-limitations

- Also, look for "grandiose" airdrop moguls who operate gated-groups, and mobilize vaporwave masses for delegation at top-notch protocols, and just ban them.

![](https://paragraph.xyz/editor/callout/information-icon.png)Quest try to malignantly gamify an existing game without offering any meta-plays given that the actual crypto-economics games are defined by the limitations of blockspace and its underlying components—which in turn offers up a sandbox for any observer if only they invest in compotetent data analysts.
