**Marketing gurus are a rare breed.** They are found to be where all at once. I remember the days right before the Covid-19 outbreak when I was pushing in the local desk of an international the blockchain technology and its possible homeruns for our not so niche sector. After 5 years, the last year to be precise, they had to adapt and adopt some infrastructure rails but I cannot blame them to be sceptics all along. After all, noone really wanted to slide their credit cards into card slots in home computer kit keyboards back in late '90s and early Noughties—yet the technology was there. There was that keyboard with which we are playing Unreal Tournament listening to Megadeth at the age of 12 at a friend's house. I recall having thought "too bad we didn't have this at home." Yet, my parents didn't even have credit cards back then.

When I encountered decentralized finance in the Spring of 2020, I didn't quite understand how I was going to be swapping between ERC20 pairs on the Ethereum mainnet. It took me some research to understand how I could cash out my first sweat equity for a protocol I'd used then—that would be a very smol airdrop. I thought everyone was cool enough to have a Larry David charisma especially in the converging set of DeFi Degens and Crypto Art connoisseurs ranging from the HTF traders—only 1 trade per block, phew!, the future!, yield hunters, conceptual artists, fine artists, not so fine artists, social network experimenter solopreneurs, lending markets ready to sponsor anything. It looked better than an oasis in Nevada. **Everyone was making the world a better place**. Artists were mastering rebases, yield mathematics, liquidity pool physics, leveraged speculation, speculative forecasting. Everyone was launching another newsletter that should eat into Bloomberg's pie, Superare was thought to be a better place than the average auction floor at the established traditionally contemporaneous art world. The art world has the scattered auction data problematic, why our kindred onchain chose the same route is still a mystery for me.

Craiglist and eBay were successful because people couldn't turned the bare internet into a marketplace themselves. They didn't know how to do it in the first place, and even if they knew, they didn't have the intermediary rails that make an application layer possible with all the necessary components. Today, we have people trying to build "onchain"—definitely not on-chain, boo!—marketplaces yet they miss a detail:

The chain is already the marketplace. It'll be futile to open up a marketplace on top of the real marketplace in 2025. That's why industrial-grade teams are having hard times pitching their marketplaces on top of marketplaces. See the latest attempt by Jesse and the team. It's like trying to gamify the game but Pump already did it by optimizing the wisdom of thousands of self-rugged launchpads.

You'll need some components unprecedented there but again at the end of the day thanks to the rise of simply usable LLM interfaces and some good documentation by the very same onchain teams, people are able to build. It's because anyone ranging from the slop normcore influencer on Tiktok or Instagram or the foxy whizkid ready to vampire fork any product onchain know that it's the fees. They'll even learn to how to do orderflow art to rent those fees.

**Creators? Artists?** Everyone knows "creator" is an umbrella term not to upset those who think of themselves as artists and trying to bite into the real artists' networks of excellence.

You'd be surprised how pro scarcity artists are and how they know about the basic home economy leveraged by trading if not saving. Better than many DeFi teams of recent months.
