## Thoughts on the Crypto Media in 2024 I

It’s been more than a year since I wrote the last This Week in Writing and NFTs post. It was a series where I mainly delved into the latest trends in nonfungibles ecosystems in terms with the practice of writing—as in either .pdfs pinned to IPFS and hashed to an ERC721, or metadata, or the art of permanent storage, let alone the smart contractual artistic enterprises that utilized the infrastructure available back then.

Lately, I have been thinking about it all again whilst federating my content over many a platform whereas I am more interested in the relation betwixt medium and datum as leveraged by decentralized technologies in the most blockchain-agnostic probable—preferring EVM supported systems over the others, though. I am yet to explore Cosmos IBC, and the currently marketually triumphant Solana. I do not think anyone will be able to christen me into any of the latter duo—I met one of my favorite artists in the space in Istanbul for an earliesh morning coffee a couple of months ago who also happen to have contributed to the Cosmos ecosystem, and that might be the only reason I am intrigued in Cosmos alongside some developments in intents-centric architectural quarters thereof when it comes to dAppchains.

I have not checked Solana since that wallet deleted their frontend, and also for I just cannot find the seedphrase—I have about 50 active wallets across 5 blockchains with all of their seed phrases and private keys registred in 2 stone books, 2 paper books, the most important ones on a titanium key registrar, not a single one of them on any password manager even though i used 4 password managers seamlessly along with passkeys.

However, that Solana seed phrase is nowhere to be found. This requires the question: Do our socially recoverable smart contract wallet infrastructures expand on their features and modularity enough? I think Privy is doing great job as long as the protocols who incorporate such technologies make use of the former and their competitors’ security features.

Now, where am I coming at? Is this another word salad with extra virgin hikikomori oil who touches the grass in the humdrum and publicly humiliating instances of Midjourney civilizations? No.

Think about the following briefly:

I think that people will be working on the intents architectures and programmable smart contract wallets with systems akin to mailing lists that had physical counterparties back in the day. We will start to see the emergence of crypto-systems native e-flux, Boomkat, Soundohm types of services that will be catering to the needs of ours at the nexuses of artistic, cultural, and consumer-ends thereof which will provide for these utterly tailored consumption patterns—digestion? I for one just consume data and digest the knowledge, which are not necessarily negative terms in the fashion I perceive the world with this second language called English.

Hence, my ideas regarding cryptomedia, crypto-native publishing, and the subscription models in the 2024 is as follows:
